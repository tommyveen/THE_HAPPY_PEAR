## INSTRUCTIONS  

1. For the marinade simply blend everything in a food processor/ blender or peel and finely chop the garlic and whisk all the ingredients together. Slice the aubergine into circles approx ½ -1 cm thick (about 4-5 slices) Peel and quarter the red onion.
2. Cover mushrooms,aubergine and onion with marinade and leave aside for 30 mins or overnight to absorb all the flavours of the marinade. Rubbing the marinade into the mushrooms and aubergine.
3. If cooking potatoes and carrots, simply par boil until cooked through but not falling apart and allow to cool. Whole new and baby potatoes are great for the bbq.
4. If using frozen corn, to defrost, boil for a few minutes, or pop in with the potatoes. Allow to cool after cooking.
Toss the corn in a little olive oil and a small pinch of salt and paprika, rubbing it evenly all over. Toss the rest of the veg in a little olive oil and a small pinch of salt.
5. The mushrooms take the longest to cook so you can put those on the BBQ first. At the same time cook 2 corn on the cob first so you can make your salsa. Cook on all 4 sides for 2-3 mins until nicely charred all over, remove from the bbq. Cook the mushrooms for approx 5 mins per size (depending on how big your portobellos are) or until the mushroom starts to soften and reduce slightly so you can flatten it.
6. When the mushrooms are halfway cooked add the aubergine, red onion,last 2 corn on the cob, carrots and potatoes to the bbq. To cook the mushroom and aubergine; cook pressing down with a spatula a few times so they get nicely charred. The aubergine slices will take 2-3 minutes per side. Cook the potatoes, last 2 corn on the cob, carrots and onions 2-3 minutes per side until nicely charred.
7. While the veg is cooking time to make the salsa. To remove the grilled corn from 2 of the cobs, stand it on its base and carefully run a sharp knife the side of the core on all sides , removing the corn, destone and roughly chop the avocado, chop the tomatoes into quarters, finely chop the coriander leaves and stalks, slice scallions, mix all together in a bowl with the juice of both limes and a pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper.
8. To serve your delicious bbq you can eat as is, or optionally slice the grilled mushrooms and serve on a bun with the aubergine, some grilled onion and your favourite burger toppings. We also like to mix some sriracha sauce with vegan mayo as a great dip for the potatoes and corn! Enjoy!
> We like to sprinkle dried ground chilli on our grilled corn and a squeeze of lime if you like to spice things up!
